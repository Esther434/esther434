#📊 Retail Store Sales Dashboard (Excel)

A 2019 Sales Analysis Dashboard for Strategic Business Insights
📝 Overview
This project presents an interactive Retail Store Sales Dashboard, developed using Microsoft Excel, 
to visualise and analyse key performance indicators (KPIS) from retail sales data for the year 2019. 
The dashboard supports business stakeholders in identifying trends, monitoring performance, and making data-informed decisions.

❓ Business Questions Answered
This dashboard was built to answer the following key questions:

What is the total sales revenue, profit earned, and quantity of products sold in 2019?

Which products generated the highest sales, and which ones performed the worst?

Which states contributed the most to profits, and which ones recorded significant losses?

How did sales fluctuate throughout the year? Are there noticeable trends or seasonal patterns?

Which shipping modes were most commonly used, and how does their usage compare?

Which customers and regions contributed the most to overall profitability?

How did each customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) perform in terms of sales and profit?

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation
To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the analysis, the dataset underwent several data cleaning and preprocessing steps:

✅ Text to Columns: Applied to separate combined data fields for better structure.

🔍 Consistency Checks: Corrected inconsistent entries across product categories, regions, and customer segments.

⚠️ Blank Values: Reviewed and handled missing or blank records where necessary.

🔁 Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate entries to prevent inaccurate aggregation.

📅 Date Formatting: Converted date fields from General to Date/Time format for proper time-based filtering.

🔢 Numerical Conversion: Reformatted key numerical columns (e.g., Sales, Profit, Quantity) from General to Number format to support calculations and visualizations.
